At Veteran Scrap Removal, we know Manchester, New Hampshire in our bones. Our family has called this city home for 100 years, one generation after another, witnessing its transformation from a bustling mill town to a thriving center of industry and culture. And within that family history, woven through decades of hard work and community spirit, lie two threads that bind us closer: service and resilience.

Our founders, have a combined 32 years of service in the US Navy and Air Force, carrying the marks of veterans. They've faced challenges head-on, adapted to the unexpected, and always answered the call with unwavering dedication. That same spirit fuels Veteran Scrap Removal. We aren't just removing clutter; we're clearing hurdles, creating fresh starts, and giving back to the community that shaped us. Whether you're tackling a major cleanout or simply need a helping hand, we'll approach your project with the grit and respect you deserve. Because in Manchester, neighbors helping neighbors is more than just a saying â€“ it's our legacy. So, let us roll up our sleeves, shoulder your burden, and leave your space pristine. This is our city, our family, and our mission. Welcome to Veteran Scrap Removal.
